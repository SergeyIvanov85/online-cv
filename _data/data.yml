    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I devoted the most significant part of my work activity to the implementation of practical tasks related to international military cooperation, carried out in order to implement the state policy in the field of military security. Implementing in practice the main provisions of international treaties in the field of arms control (Vienna Document 2011, Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, Treaty on Open Skies), gained experience in performing the following tasks and functions:
      - implementation of the state policy of the Republic of Belarus in the field of arms control, preparation of proposals for its development;
      - implementation of information and analytical activities in the field of arms control, taking into account the interests of military security;
      - negotiating arms control issues;
      - formation and improvement of the legal framework in the field of arms control;
      - preparation of data and briefings on the fulfillment by the Republic of Belarus of obligations on international treaties in the field of arms control;
      - participation in the provision of foreign inspection (observation) within the framework of international treaties in the field of arms control on the territory of the Republic of Belarus and verification of compliance with treaty obligations by other participating States.

      Currently, holding the position of head of international military cooperation branch in the "western" direction, I am directly responsible for the implementation of the tasks and functions of cooperation:
      - with the states of North and South America, Africa, Europe, Southeast Asia ;
      - with international organizations (UN, OSCE, NATO, ICRC, etc.), including within the framework of international conventions (destruction of stocks of APM, SALW, etc.) in the interests of developing and improving mechanisms for ensuring global and regional security, increasing the openness and transparency of military-political processes, reducing tension in the region, as well as participating in activities to maintain international peace and security.

      At the same time, I am not resting on my laurels and in connection with the end of my military career, I am actively in progress in the field of web development as a front-end developer.
